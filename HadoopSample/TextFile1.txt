HDInsight clusters are available in various types, 
each for a single workload or technology.
There is no supported method to create a cluster that combines multiple types, 
such as Storm and HBase on one cluster. If your solution requires technologies that are spread 
across multiple HDInsight cluster types, an Azure virtual network can connect the required cluster types.
